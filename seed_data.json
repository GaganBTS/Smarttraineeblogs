It depends on your activity level, sometimes you fidget more and correspondingly you need more calories and conversely on some days your activity levels are low and therefore you need less calories to maintain your weight.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These formulas will give you a ballpark amount, a starting point from where you can orientate things according to your needs</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Eric Helms formula</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/eric-helms-formula.png\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/eric-helms-formula.png\" alt=\"eric helms formula\" width=\"274\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"700\" data-original-width=\"600\"></a></div>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"separator\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">M.C = maintenance calories&hellip;.. this formula is same for both male and female.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So according to eric helms formula, if your weight is 75kg/165lbs and according to your lifestyle you fall under activity multiplier of 1.7, then your maintenance calories are 75*22*1.7/165*10*1.7 = 2805 calories.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Revised Harris Benedict Formula</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/revised-harris-benedict-equation.png?w=768\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/revised-harris-benedict-equation.png?w=768\" alt=\"harris benedict formula\" width=\"320\" height=\"285\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"682\" data-original-width=\"767\"></a></div>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"separator\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/revised-harris-benedict-equation-1.png?w=491\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/revised-harris-benedict-equation-1.png?w=491\" alt=\"revised harris benedict formula\" width=\"320\" height=\"284\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"436\" data-original-width=\"491\"></a></div>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"separator\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<br>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you&rsquo;re thinking what the heck is<strong>&nbsp;BMR</strong>, It is the amount of calories your body needs to perform basic functions like digestion,thinking,blood circulation. So, if you&rsquo;re just sitting on couch for all day long, you still need calories equal to&nbsp;<strong>BMR(Basal Metabolic Rate)</strong>&nbsp;for your body to perform basic functions smoothly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What if you want to precisely calculate your Maintenance Calories</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What if you don&rsquo;t want to calculate your maintenance calories from the formulas above and want a more personalized method? Well, congrats! there exists a method which will gratify your wish but it needs more time, energy, thought, perseverance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>THE TRIAL AND ERROR METHOD</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To commence, you must elicit a digital bodyweight scale, a digital food weighing scale, a food tracking app like myfitnesspal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After you&rsquo;ve accumulated these resources, let&rsquo;s say you just choose an amount of 2500 calories for the next 14 days, Then</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day in the morning, after you&rsquo;ve used the washroom, empty stomach, step on the weighing scale and weigh yourself. Note down the weight.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Track your calorie consumption for the entire day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">after 14 days, take 3 averages:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average weight of week 1(w1)</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average weight of week 2(w2)</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Average calories consumed each day over the course of 14 days</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1600500627716.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1600500627716.jpg\" alt=\"practical way to calculate maintenance calories\" width=\"320\" height=\"230\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"519\" data-original-width=\"720\"></a></div>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"separator\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For instance, if w1 comes out to be 151 lbs and w2 comes out be 150.5 lbs, and the average calorie intake is 2500kcal/day. That means you&rsquo;ve lost 0.5 lbs on a 2500kcal diet.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Now enters the 3500 calories rule which means that 1lb of fat is equivalent to 3500 calories approximately. That means over 7 days you created a deficit of:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Weekly deficit = 0.5*3500 = 1750kcal means 250kcal deficit per day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The above numbers tell us that while eating at 2500 calories you were at the deficit of 250kcal per day which attest that:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Maintenance calories = 2500+250 = 2750 calories.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This method is relatively more reliable and individualized but needs more patience, perseverance, and effort.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you&rsquo;re consuming any number of calories and your weight is still not decreasing or increasing, it means that you&rsquo;re still eating around your maintenance calories. So, from there you&rsquo;ve to adjust the amount in accordance with your needs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So. that&rsquo;s all about today&rsquo;s blog. I've explained you every possible method using which you can<strong>&nbsp;calculate your maintenance calories.</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">See you all in the next blog.

So you should eat mixture of foods like rice with pulses, chapatti with kidney beans, pulses, legumes, so that you can get complete source of protein containing complete amino acids profile.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">3.&nbsp;<strong>Procure a whey protein&nbsp;</strong>if you're unable to fulfil your protein intake from whole foods.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgMlperydInm2L9jJJHycLpf5XrOUykbabgipTQs9F0cm80RvKBjk-92XtZr2eMMmpY8A7im1oee6FvtnIbcfPbxYvcj1m8paNXsrm8T_P1nPuXj5paEHTSL7N9iregWhq4SGyZvP_Yo4l1wPu9B0FLbBz3sFigJXXigKEb3v0OSBY58GnnNP50HfPjNg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgMlperydInm2L9jJJHycLpf5XrOUykbabgipTQs9F0cm80RvKBjk-92XtZr2eMMmpY8A7im1oee6FvtnIbcfPbxYvcj1m8paNXsrm8T_P1nPuXj5paEHTSL7N9iregWhq4SGyZvP_Yo4l1wPu9B0FLbBz3sFigJXXigKEb3v0OSBY58GnnNP50HfPjNg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" data-original-height=\"469\" data-original-width=\"625\"></a></div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">TDEE- total daily energy expenditure</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So, you fancy losing weight but you are unable to go to gym or maybe you don&rsquo;t want to look so muscular, your goal is just to shed some fat, stay healthy so you can do your daily activities seamlessly, I got you covered. Here are some simple tips you need to follow in order to achieve your goal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Eat in calorie deficit</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What does that mean? It simply means eating less than your body needs. How can you eat less? Do you need to calculate your maintenance calories?</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Well, it&rsquo;s simple.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Just reduce the portion of food you&rsquo;re currently eating. For instance, if you&rsquo;re consuming 3 bread sandwiches in the morning, just reduce it to 1 or 2.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In this way start reducing the amount of food you&rsquo;re consuming in a day and you&rsquo;ll automatically fall under calorie deficit.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">REMEMBER, if you&rsquo;re not in a calorie deficit, then the next tips i am going to give you will never work. Eating less(calorie deficit) is the cornerstone of fat loss.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Increase your protein intake</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What is protein? how much protein you need in a day? &ndash; I&rsquo;ve already covered this topic in one of my previous blogs,<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blog/post/edit/6438349933115263535/4360190144190396386\">&nbsp;check it out.</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Here i am going to tell you that how can you increase your protein intake.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>FOR VEGETARIANS:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>FOR NON &ndash; VEGETARIANS:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Increase the intake of</strong>&nbsp;chicken, eggs(only egg white not whole eggs), fish and procure a whey protein if you&rsquo;re not able to fulfill your protein needs from food.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Increase your activity levels</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exercise and diet go hand in hand.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blog/post/edit/6438349933115263535/4360190144190396386\">In one of my previous blogs, i elucidated energy balance.</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The food you&rsquo;re consuming in a day is ENERGY IN and if this ENERGY IN will exceed ENERGY OUT, you&rsquo;ll gain fat.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So, to increase your ENERGY OUT, you&rsquo;ve to increase your daily activity levels.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Commence with baby steps. Let&rsquo;s suppose right now your step count in one day is 6000, increase it by 600-1000 per week. There are many other avenues by which you can mount the activity levels like brisk walking, jogging, running or taking part in any of your favorite sports.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Have some cheat meals</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yes have some favorite foods of your once or twice a week. This will help you mentally to stick to your fat loss goal.&nbsp;<strong>Even researches have proved that people who take refeeds( cheat meals) can longer adhere to fat loss than who don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</strong>So, once or twice a week, have a pizza, burger, pancake or anything of your choice&nbsp;<strong>but don&rsquo;t binge eat</strong>. For instance, you ate a burger which is fine but you ordered large coca cola, french fries, pizza along with it, that is not at all conducive to your goal. Eat mindfully not mindlessly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Replace fast food snacks with healthy snacks</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If your daily routine is like you eat a packet of chips every evening. Well, time to alter things. Supplant that packet of chips with something fulfilling and nutritious like a peanut butter sandwich, sprouts, mix salad etc.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Packet of chips contain simple carbohydrates( fast digesting) which ain&rsquo;t fulfilling and you feel hungry even after eating them. While on the other side, a bowl of sprout or mix salad contains complex carbs(slow digesting) and fiber which keeps you fulfilled for along time and you don&rsquo;t feel hungry after consuming them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>TAKEAWAYS:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fat loss is more about altering habits rather than altering diet. So, build good eating and exercising habits, apply above provided tips and you&rsquo;ll certainly achieve your fat loss goal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So, that&rsquo;s all about today&rsquo;s blog.

Well, they are not alike.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As I&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smarttraineeblogs.blogspot.com/2022/08/body-recomposition-doable-or-not.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">elucidated in one of my blogs</a>&nbsp;that our body weight is composed of fat mass and fat free mass(muscle mass).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Weight gain, as the name implies that you&rsquo;re gaining weight but you may be gaining purely fat mass, muscle mass or blend of both. When we talk about muscle gain, it means we will try to gain more and more weight from muscle mass keeping the weight gain from fat mass to minimum.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">NOTE: You cannot gain purely muscle mass while keeping fat gain to absolute zero as a natural lifter. Obviously and surely, you will gain some amount of fat mass along with muscle but our goal is to gain most of the weight from muscle mass while keeping fat gain to the least we can.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Mass Gainers</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Now&rsquo; let&rsquo;s dive into main topic of this blog.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mass gainers are one of the oldest and most eminent supplements in the market. Every major company has it&rsquo;s own range of mass gainers with glitzy names &ndash; XXL mass gainers, extreme mass gainers, serious mass etc.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Stop Being Fooled</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mass gainers are marketed in such a way that majority of the population is forced to believe that it miraculously aids in gaining muscle mass.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Well, muscle gaining is and will always remain a combination of optimal training, nutrition and recovery.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Supplements and everything else will always be secondary. Hence, one or even multiple tubs of mass gainers won&rsquo;t get you jacked like the athlete on it&rsquo;s packaging.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What are mass gainers?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A mass gainer is basically the powdered form of a meal. It majorly contains carbohydrates(65-70%), moderate amount of protein(20-30%) and a crumb of fats(5-10%).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So, these are simply supplements that help you consume extra calories. This eventuates in&nbsp;<strong>increased calorie intake, which is cornerstone for putting on muscle mass</strong>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Instances where mass gainer can be useful</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">1.&nbsp;You are underweight and have a small appetite. Mass gainer can feed your body with a good chunk of calories and because of being in liquid form, appetite won&rsquo;t be an issue.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">2.&nbsp;You can only eat 2-3 meals after long gaps. Here mass gainer can be used as a snack meal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">3.&nbsp;You cannot pack a meal for college/office and all there available is junk or low quality food. Here, a mass gainer can be extremely useful in hitting your macronutrients target.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Which mass gainer to buy?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you do require a mass gainer, following are the most important considerations:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">It has at least 15gram of protein per scoop(per scoop, not per serving)</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Ensure that the source of protein is a quality one like whey concentrate, isolate, casein, egg protein or blend of all three.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Check carbohydrate source. Avoid dextrose based mass gainers. Maltodextrin and waxy maize are acceptable. Complex carb sources like oats, quinoa powder are best.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">DONE.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">That&rsquo;s all about today&rsquo;s blog, I've explained everything you need to know about<strong>&nbsp;mass gainers.</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">See you all in my next blog.

These protein supplements ain&rsquo;t magical, they just fulfil your protein requirements which you can&rsquo;t reap from the diet. That&rsquo;s it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For instance, if your protein requirement for the day is 160 gram, try to consume 80-100 gram from whole foods and rest you can slake from these protein supplements and if you&rsquo;re able to slake all 160 gram from whole foods, that&rsquo;s splendid.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whole foods contains numerous vital nutrients other than protein. So, getting ample protein from whole foods should be your first priority and then if you&rsquo;re unable to satiate your protein needs, then go for a protein supplement.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>TYPES OF PROTEIN SUPPLEMENTS</strong></p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>WHEY PROTEIN:</strong>&nbsp;This is extracted from milk. It is the liquid that separates from curd during cheese making progress. It&rsquo;s high in protein and also contains lactose &ndash; a milk sugar.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Whey protein is further of three types:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Concentrate whey:</strong>&nbsp;Produced by extracting protein from milk, these typically delivers 60-80% protein, with remaining 20-40% consists of fat and carbs. It is high in lactose comparing to another types of whey.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://i3.pureformulas.net/images/product/large/whey-protein-concentrate-unflavored-15-lbs-by-now.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://i3.pureformulas.net/images/product/large/whey-protein-concentrate-unflavored-15-lbs-by-now.jpg\" alt=\"CONCENTRATE WHEY\" width=\"240\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-original-width=\"600\"></a></div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"separator\">\r\n<div class=\"separator\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"separator\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">2.&nbsp;<strong>Whey isolates:&nbsp;</strong>An additional filtering process removes fat and carbs, further concentrating the protein. While whey protein retains some lactose, the isolate version contains very little lactose because most of the sugar is lost during protein processing.

I already expatiated about sleep in one of my erstwhile blogs, i elucidated everything why sleep matters, health risks of rotten sleep, how much sleep you need?<a href=\"https://smarttraineeblogs.blogspot.com/2022/08/sleep-irreplaceable-supplement.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;&ndash; you can check out that blog by clicking here.</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In this blog, I will pontificate about some supplements that can help you in getting good sleep if you find yourself jittery and unable to sleep well.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So if you want little aid in acquiring good sleep, consider these four supplements:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>MELATONIN</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Melatonin is a hormone which your body produces naturally, which signals your brain that it is the time to sack out.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The hormone&rsquo;s cycle of production and release is influenced by the time of day &ndash; melatonin levels naturally rise in evening and fall down in morning.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Melatonin supplements have became a popular sleeping aid, particularly in instances where melatonin cycle is disrupted.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Several studies report that melatonin improves daytime sleep quality and duration. This is particularly beneficial for those whose schedule require them to sleep during daytime.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Specifically, melatonin seems to reduce the time people need to fall asleep and increases the total amount of sleep.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Studies which observed beneficial effects generally provided participants 3-10 mg of melatonin before bedtime.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>MAGNESIUM</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Magnesium is a mineral involved in hundreds of processes in human body and is important for brain functioning and heart health. In addition, magnesium may help quiet the mind and body, making it easier to fall asleep.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Studies shown that magnesium&rsquo;s relaxing effect may be due to its ability to regulate melatonin production. Magnesium also seems to elevate the levels of gamma-amino butyric acid &ndash; a brain messenger with calming effects.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Studies have shown that insufficient levels of magnesium in your body are likely to trouble sleep.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One study gave 46 participants 500mg of magnesium or a placebo daily for 8 weeks. Those in magnesium group experienced better overall sleep quality. This group also had higher levels of melatonin and renin, two hormones that regulate sleep.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>LAVENDER</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lavender is a plant that can be found on almost all continents. Lavender&rsquo;s soothing fragrance is believed to enhance sleep. In fact several studies show that simply smelling lavender oil for 30 minutes before sleep maybe enough to improve the quality of sleep.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This effect appears particularly strong in those suffering from mild insomnia. Another study gave 221 patients suffering from mixed anxiety disorder 80mg of lavender oil supplement or a placebo per day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By the end of 10-week study, both groups had experienced improvement in quality and duration of sleep. However the lavender group experienced 14-24% greater effects, without any reported side effects.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">GLYCINE</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Glycine is an amino acid that plays an important role in nervous system. Recent studies showed that it may also help improve sleep.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exactly how this works is unknown, but glycine is thought to act in by lowering body temperature at bed time, signaling that it&rsquo;s time for sleep.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In one study, participants suffering from poor sleep consuming 3gram of glycine or a placebo immediately before bedtime &nbsp;showed improved objective measures of sleep quality compared with the placebo group. Glycine supplements also helped participants fall asleep faster.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can buy glycine in pill form or as a powder that can be diluted in water. Taking up to 0.8 grams/kg of body weight per day appears to be safe, but more studies are needed. Many sleep study participants only took 3 grams a day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can also increase your glycine intake by eating foods rich in the nutrient, including:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><strong>Animal products such as bone broth, meat, eggs, poultry, and fish</strong></li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><strong>Beans</strong></li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><strong>Spinach</strong></li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><strong>Kale</strong></li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><strong>Cabbage</strong></li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><strong>Fruits like bananas and kiwi</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">DONE.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So that&rsquo;s all about today&rsquo;s blog, I've explained the most prominents&nbsp;<strong>supplements that can help promoting good sleep.</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">See you all in my next blog.

class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>Fiber is one of the most avoided but important macro for our fitness goals. As a fitness enthusiasts, we often emphasize more on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smarttraineeblogs.blogspot.com/2022/08/everything-you-need-to-know-about.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protein</a>, fats, supplements but in that run we overlook the importance of fiber. Fiber is incredibly imperative.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>WHAT IS FIBER?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Fiber is a type of carbohydrate but unlike other carbs, it cannot be broken down into digestible sugar molecules/glucose. Therefore, fiber passes through the intestinal tract intact.</p>\r\n<p>Fiber is classified as&nbsp;soluble&nbsp;which dissolves in water and&nbsp;insoluble&nbsp;which doesn&rsquo;t dissolve in water.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Soluble fiber:&nbsp;This type of fiber dissolves in water to form a gel like material. It can help lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels. Soluble fiber is found in&nbsp;<strong>oats, peas, beans, apples, citrus fruits, carrots, barley.</strong></li>\r\n<li>Insoluble fiber:&nbsp;This type of fiber promotes the movement of material through your digestive system and increase stool bulk, so it can be beneficial for those who struggle with constipation or irregular stools.&nbsp;<strong>Whole wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts, beans and vegetables</strong>&nbsp;are good sources of insoluble fiber.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The amount of soluble and insoluble fiber varies in different plant foods. To elicit greatest health benefits, eat a wide variety of high fiber foods.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>WHY FIBER IS VITAL?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A high fiber diet:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Normalize bowel movements:&nbsp;Dietary fiber increases the weight and size of your stool and softens it. A bulky and soft stool is easy to pass, decreasing your chances of constipation.</li>\r\n<li>Helps maintain bowel health:&nbsp;A high fiber diet may lower your risk of developing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/hemorrhoids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hemorrhoids.</a></li>\r\n<li>Lower cholesterol levels:&nbsp;Soluble fiber in beans, oats, flaxseed may help lower blood cholesterol levels by lowering low density lipo protein(bad cholesterol) levels.</li>\r\n<li>Helps control blood sugar levels:&nbsp;In people with diabetes fiber particularly soluble fiber can slowdown the absorption of sugar and help improve blood sugar levels. A healthy diet containing insoluble fiber also reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes.</li>\r\n<li>Helps in satiety:&nbsp;High fiber foods keep you satiated and filled for long time and you won&rsquo;t feel like eating more and more. This is helpful for those whose goal is fat loss as they&rsquo;re in calorie deficit. So, consuming ample fiber will keep them satiated and prevent them from eating galore.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color\"><strong>HOW MUCH FIBER?</strong></p>\r\n<p>While there are many general recommendations that men should consume 25g fiber and women should consume 20g per day. But the more individualized recommendation would be 10-15g/1000 calories rule.</p>\r\n<p>It means that for every 1000 calories you should consume 10g-15g fiber. So if your daily calorie intake is 2000 kcal, you should consume 20-30g of fiber.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-442\" src=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/how-much.png?w=1024\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" srcset=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/how-much.png?w=468 468w, https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/how-much.png?w=936 936w, https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/how-much.png?w=150 150w, https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/how-much.png?w=300 300w, https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/how-much.png?w=768 768w\" alt=\"how much fiber your body needs\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"442\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"how-much\" data-large-file=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/how-much.png?w=580\" data-medium-file=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/how-much.png?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/how-much.png\" data-orig-size=\"1080,1080\" data-permalink=\"https://smarttrainee.health.blog/how-much/\"></figure>\r\n<p>PRO TIP:&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t consume fiber in ungodly amounts as that might make you feel bloated/cause a heaviness in your stomach.</p>\r\n<p>So, that&rsquo;s all about today&rsquo;s blog, I've explained you everything you need to know about&nbsp;<strong>Fiber: An Underlying Macro</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>See you all in my next blog.

Without that extra testosterone, females can&rsquo;t build the big muscle like guys. It&rsquo;s science,so stop brooding.

They contain simple carbs(fast digesting) so that you won&rsquo;t feel any heaviness in your stomach.</p>\r\n<p>Simple carbohydrates like dextrose, fructose, glucose are broken down expeditiously by the body to be used as energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color has-larger-font-size\"><strong>GOAL OF INTRA WORKOUT DRINKS</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>HYDRATION:</strong>&nbsp;During workout you must stay properly hydrated because even 2 percent dehydration can affect your performance. Due to sweating, water loss happens and one of the primary goals of the intraworkout(I.W) drinks is hydration. That&rsquo;s why water is a major component in I.W drinks.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>ENERGIZE:</strong>&nbsp;I.W drinks contain simple carbs to boost performance and amino acids to boost your recovery.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>ELECTROLYTE REPLENISHMENT:</strong>&nbsp;Most I.W drinks contain Na+ and K+ electrolytes because when we sweat, not only water loss takes place but it also leads to loss of electrolytes in our body.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-larger-font-size\"><strong>DO YOU REALLY NEED I.W DRINKS?</strong></p>\r\n<p>It is validated in researches that if your workout duration is less than or equal to 90 minutes, you don&rsquo;t need any fancy I.W drinks.</p>\r\n<p>Even most intense workouts deplete glycogen(it is a form of glucose which gives you energy during any intense activity) stores only by 35-40% and when it comes to amino acids, if you had taken a protein source before your workout, then amino acids are already present in your body which will aid you in recovery and performance. Even if you haven&rsquo;t taken any protein source 1-2 hours before your workout but if you&rsquo;re hitting your daily protein goal &ndash; no need to worry then.</p>\r\n<p>Mostly endurance athletes need I.W drinks who continuously without any rest train for 2-3 hours like boxers, cricketers, footballers.</p>\r\n<p>So, for the rest of the people who just go to gym, they don&rsquo;t need any special drinks during workout and the best I.W drink for them is&nbsp;WATER, yes that&rsquo;s it, nothing else.</p>\r\n<p>One research was conducted in 2008 in which one group was given water and other group was given an I.W drink during their workout and the research concluded that there was no significant difference between the performance of both groups.</p>\r\n<p>Most common I.W drinks are BCAA&rsquo;s(branch chain amino acids) and EAA&rsquo;s(essential amino acids).</p>\r\n<p><strong>which of them is better?</strong></p>\r\n<p>BCAA&rsquo;s were all the rage 5-6 years ago but nowadays EAA&rsquo;s have outshined them because EAA&rsquo;s in them contain BCAA&rsquo;s along with other essential amino acids. So, in EAA&rsquo;s, you will be getting a complete profile of amino acids.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Does I.W drinks consumption helps you in achieving your physique goal?</p>\r\n<p>To put it bluntly, NO. These drinks are just to give you a quiver of energy you may need to perform optimally in the gym. Achieving your goal physique depends on your daily&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smarttraineeblogs.blogspot.com/2022/08/everything-you-need-to-know-about.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protein&nbsp;</a>intake, overall diet and training.</p>\r\n<p>So that&rsquo;s all about today&rsquo;s blog, I've explained you everything you need to know about&nbsp;<strong>Intra Workout Nutrition.</strong></p>\r\n<p>See you all in my next blog.

It stores high energy phosphate groups in the form of phospho creatine which are donated to ADP(Adenosine Bi Phosphate), regenerating it to ATP(Adenosine Tri Phosphate), the primary energy carrier in the body.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>Benefits of Creatine</strong></h2>\r\n<p>The main purpose and primary benefit for which creatine is well researched is an improvement in strength and power output during resistance exercise. When used in conjunction with resistance exercise, creatine mildly increase the lean mass(muscle mass).</p>\r\n<p>Indirectly, creatine also aids in negating fatigue by increasing the strength and power output.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color\"><strong>Side Effects</strong></h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>If you consume creatine without enough water, stomach cramping can occur. Diarrhea and nausea can occur when too much creatine is taken at once.</li>\r\n<li>Creatine can cause bloating but it is purely water weight. So, no need to worry about that.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> If any supplement selling company is professing that their creatine doesn&rsquo;t cause bloating, it means that their product is ineffective or it&rsquo;s not creatine but just a cheap supplement which they are selling under the guise of creatine.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>Best Form of Creatine and Dosage</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are plethora of forms of creatine present in the market but&nbsp;creatine monohydrate&nbsp;is the most cheapest and most researched form of creatine and it is widely used.</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to dosage, according to various researches, the best results were noticed at dosage of 0.03 &ndash; 0.05g/kg of body weight per day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\">Creatine and Kidneys</p>\r\n<p>To store creatine you ingest and creatine your liver produce, your skeleton muscle, your brain and other tissues transform it into phosphocreatine and when they use their stores to recycle ATP, one of the byproduct is creatine.</p>\r\n<p>Kidneys excrete this by product unchanged. If their functioning deteriorates, so does creatinine clearance.</p>\r\n<p>Creatinine clearance can be estimated from a blood test or through a combination of blood test and 24 hours urine test. Creatinine blood levels are most commonly used as indicator of kidney function. If your levels are high, your kidneys are not doing the job optimally.</p>\r\n<p>Although taking creatine may increase creatinine levels, long and short term studies have validated that dose &lt;= 10g/day don&rsquo;t impair kidney health in people with healthy kidneys.</p>\r\n<p>If you have or had some kidneys related issues in past, then do consult your physician before consuming creatine.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\">Creatine Loading</p>\r\n<p>Creatine is a supplement that is known for having &ldquo;loading phase&rdquo; followed by a &ldquo;maintenance phase&rdquo;. Typical creatine loading looks like:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Taking 20-25g for 5-7 days</li>\r\n<li>Taking 5-10g for 3-4 weeks</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\">Do you need to load creatine?</p>\r\n<p>No, you do not need to load creatine. Many studies that observed the benefits of creatine used either a straight dose of 5-10g/day or even smaller amounts(2-3g/day).</p>\r\n<p>And as mentioned previously, taking too much creatine at once can cause diarrhea in some people. So, better to keep yourself on safe side of&nbsp;<strong>consuming 3-5g/kg of creatine per day</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, that&rsquo;s all about today&rsquo;s blog, I've explained you&nbsp;<strong>All About Creatine</strong>.

For example, if a grossly obese person is endeavoring to lose fat, in that process he will also gain some muscle as the body will use extra energy from ungodly fat to fuel muscle gain.</p>\r\n<p>This is due to the law of thermodynamics &ndash; &ldquo;Energy can neither be created, nor can be destroyed, but can be transformed from one form to another&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>In which cases it is feasible?</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Newbie lifters&nbsp;have best chance for body recomposition because they&rsquo;re predominantly primed for muscle building. Also calories/energy can be pulled from fat to fuel muscle building.</li>\r\n<li>Overweight individuals&nbsp;can eat in a calorie deficit and still have ample energy stores to fuel muscle building.</li>\r\n<li>Detrained individuals&nbsp;that have built decent level of muscle before can clinch body recomposition.

Originally studied as a possible way to prevent muscle soreness and enhance recovery but lately, researches in human subjects has shown that high dose supplementation with vitamin C and E can negate some of it&rsquo;s health promoting benefits, other studies have shown that antioxidants may deplete exercise performance or delay recovery.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\">ROS from mitochondria are needed for muscle cell membrane repair</p>\r\n<p>It has been known for some time that mitochondria are particularly important in the muscle repair process. Researches found that upon damage to cell membrane, calcium which exists in a much higher concentration outside of a cell, rush inside the cell. After rushing into cell through damaged cell membranes, extra calcium is expeditiously absorbed by mitochondria.</p>\r\n<p>Researchers found that this aids to prevent calcium from becoming too high and killing the cell, and also send cue to mitochondria to increase ROS production.</p>\r\n<p>This increase in mitochondrial ROS production is essential to repairing membranes of muscles and other cell types after injury.</p>\r\n<p>Now consuming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smarttraineeblogs.blogspot.com/2022/08/vital-micronutrients-you-should-be.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vitamin C or E</a>&nbsp;prevents ROS levels from increasing and restricts the ability of muscle fibers to repair cell damage which will result in delayed recovery and will also limit force production&nbsp;i.e. deteriorating your strength and performance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-secondary-color has-text-color\">TAKEAWAY:</p>\r\n<p>Although antioxidants are an essential part of our diet, but they should preferably be eluded around workout time as they can wreck your performance, strength output and will delay the recovery process.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s all about today&rsquo;s blog, I've explained everything about whether you should consume&nbsp;<strong>antioxidants in post workout&nbsp;</strong>or not.</p>\r\n<p>See you all in my next blog.

Rest I will cover in forthcoming blog.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>ADHERENCE: THE KEY</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t adhere to your plan even if it is the best training plan of all time, you won&rsquo;t get satisfactory results.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For instance, you downloaded the 6 day training plan of your favourite bodybuilder from the internet but your lifestyle doesn&rsquo;t facilitate you to train 6 days/week, you&rsquo;ll end up being peeved and disheartened.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&ldquo;Even if your plan is not the optimal one but you find it easy to adhere with, you relish doing it, it will give you results.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Components of ADHERENCE:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg_N5kQ1rNSl5_Jws1A7eWJRiAGZQZQMvw_iaNRTPDnXQS9VvOgcD1D7dFBf9Xd0a59zRyz8MsFuawGjAjZS_bn8xs0TciPDR3Ac_WGSdckIIMxQYlEvYCi8w_TIeOxOwJhgOZz2JiFScsExs0PmgWl8kOLfuHGqPtTRmQ7ciGL_NkxPssiXQoBif56gA\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg_N5kQ1rNSl5_Jws1A7eWJRiAGZQZQMvw_iaNRTPDnXQS9VvOgcD1D7dFBf9Xd0a59zRyz8MsFuawGjAjZS_bn8xs0TciPDR3Ac_WGSdckIIMxQYlEvYCi8w_TIeOxOwJhgOZz2JiFScsExs0PmgWl8kOLfuHGqPtTRmQ7ciGL_NkxPssiXQoBif56gA\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"200\" data-original-height=\"358\" data-original-width=\"572\"></a></div>\r\n<p><br><br></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>REALISTIC</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The first question you should ask yourself is that if your training program is realistic and doable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>TIME FRAME</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you&rsquo;ve only one hour in a day to be spared for training/workout, then your training plan must match with your time frame. I mean how much sustaining it would be if the training program you created demands 2 hours and you&rsquo;ve just one hour to devote to your workout.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&ldquo;Consistency is what bring the results rather than perfection&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">2.&nbsp;<strong>SCHEDULE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You also need to contemplate your schedule on week to week basis. If you&rsquo;ve decided that &ldquo;optimal approach&rdquo; is training 6 days a week, yet you&rsquo;re a father who works 50 hours/week, has a hobby, tends to have family commitments on weekends, so the &ldquo;6 days/week plan&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t your cup of tea.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve to start with what you can do before deciding what you should do.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>ENJOYABLE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After realistic comes enjoyable. are you feeling invigorated or drained after a workout? Is your workout giving you joint pains?</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So why enjoyment is important? I guarantee that if you take a suboptimal plan that you love, you&rsquo;ll put more effort into it than if you take an optimal plan which you don&rsquo;t enjoy at all.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fitness is along term game. So, if you&rsquo;re not enjoying your workout, chances are that you&rsquo;re going to be inconsistent and ultimately will wimp out of workout/training.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&ldquo;Optimal doesn&rsquo;t equal sustainable, don&rsquo;t set yourself up for failure.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>VOLUME: A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Volume is the total amount of work you do in the gym.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>volume = sets*reps*weight on the bar</strong>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So, how many sets you should do for one muscle group/week?</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The answer is&nbsp;<strong>10-20 sets</strong>&nbsp;per muscle group per week. Keep in mind the&nbsp;<strong>overlapping muscles.</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For instance on compound lifts like bench press, you ain&rsquo;t just training your chest but also triceps while lifting the bar up and down. So, by virtue of this maybe you don&rsquo;t need to train your triceps as hard as you&rsquo;re hitting your chest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Volume is the key driver of hypertrophy(increase in size and improvement in the shape of muscles) but more volumes isn&rsquo;t good always. Many researches have attested that increase in volume beyond 10-20 sets per muscle per week actually has detrimental effects on strength and hypertrophy levels, that&rsquo;s why i called volume a double edged sword. To read more about volume you can grab a copy of the book&nbsp;<a href=\"https://muscleandstrengthpyramids.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">training pyramid by eric helms</a>&nbsp;or just can watch the eric helms video about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9SQ97rfyO4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">volume on YouTube.</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>PROGRESSION</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to gym but completely oblivious about the concept of progression, you&rsquo;re just breaking the bones.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What is progression or progressive overload?</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It means making your muscles work harder than they are used to or in simple terms to increase the total work you&rsquo;re doing in the gym. By work i mean to say to increase the volume of your workout.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>volume = sets*reps*weight on the bar</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">How to progressively overload?</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhJFYRth9liz09s2jTBvG4UeKCFPr1VNQGnx_yuoK7dx7w2aDhg2caeUcFq6JYtSPnqH88rpXWpkRXAXX0ZU0hVdm50hsOnxW-MumWbSzAGXBpX8-SglMl-cEw0a7Qpwv4tMDEE1xePoNYFqWZnLffEiazSAGD4VOwMk5ckQlXKapgmjxoiY0uwivUTpA\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhJFYRth9liz09s2jTBvG4UeKCFPr1VNQGnx_yuoK7dx7w2aDhg2caeUcFq6JYtSPnqH88rpXWpkRXAXX0ZU0hVdm50hsOnxW-MumWbSzAGXBpX8-SglMl-cEw0a7Qpwv4tMDEE1xePoNYFqWZnLffEiazSAGD4VOwMk5ckQlXKapgmjxoiY0uwivUTpA\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"200\" data-original-height=\"377\" data-original-width=\"604\"></a></div>\r\n<p><br><br></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For instance, you hit 8 reps of bench press with 100kg weight on the bar, now next week when you&rsquo;ll again hit bench press try to increase the weight on the bar or the reps with same weight. You don&rsquo;t need to increase the weight drastically, even the increment of 1kg or 1 rep will increase the total volume of your workout, don&rsquo;t make big jumps.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&ldquo;progress is progress even if it is slow or imperfect.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So, that&rsquo;s all about today&rsquo;s blog.

The premise behind this split is to smash a muscle completely in one day and then give it 5-6 days to recover from the fatigue/workload.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">when i was new to fitness, i was also one of the fan of bro split but when i started reading researches and all other stuff, i came to knew that researchers have refuted the premise of bro split.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">numerous researches have validated that if your diet is on point, a muscle takes only 48-72 hours to recover completely from the erstwhile workout. So, 48-72 hours roughly means 2-3 days.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It takes only 2-3 days for a muscle to recover completely. So, in bro split by giving that muscle extra 2-3 days, you&rsquo;re just putting that muscle in an idle state.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Also if you&rsquo;ll try to hit chest on just one day, you won&rsquo;t be able to perform every movement with you 100% because as the session drags on, you will get more fatigued both mentally and physically.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A research was conducted in which scientist Schoenfeld compared two 3 days per week training programs in well trained men with different frequencies per muscle group. One was split where the lifter train chest and back on day one, legs on day two and shoulder and arms on day three, while the second group trained full body on everyday. The exercises, sets, reps and loads were the same across the week in both groups, and interestingly significantly greater increase in hypertrophy(increase in muscle size and improvement in muscle composition) were observed in the group training full body three days per week.</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>FREQUENCY RECOMMENDATIONS:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Try to spread the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smarttraineeblogs.blogspot.com/2022/09/how-to-approach-trainingworkout.html\">total volume</a>&nbsp;in a way which allows you to train your muscles<strong>&nbsp;2-3 times a week.</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The two most famous splits which allows you to train your muscle 2-3 times are&nbsp;<strong>push pull leg split and upper lower body split.</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj4idEsr0A3Gs6t5MW2yJVabSG1k1RneTf4hXnSM7QIY4AxOPD6AhI4P7hCNVDTS15tMyrZ2_AkDaq0ADT7YuN9hZI5Jj4am6k0osl5H7Eps3nQq2LgrMOELtyc0SC8dXiDPt105WMGFegHl18CgV3v8N3mg7mfn6YKyqH_MUHFN-PpJmTdm63fXxz9jA\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"RPE and RIR\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj4idEsr0A3Gs6t5MW2yJVabSG1k1RneTf4hXnSM7QIY4AxOPD6AhI4P7hCNVDTS15tMyrZ2_AkDaq0ADT7YuN9hZI5Jj4am6k0osl5H7Eps3nQq2LgrMOELtyc0SC8dXiDPt105WMGFegHl18CgV3v8N3mg7mfn6YKyqH_MUHFN-PpJmTdm63fXxz9jA\" alt=\"RPE and RIR\" width=\"317\" height=\"240\" data-original-height=\"456\" data-original-width=\"603\"></a></div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjWFVx8kVEFd3GIB1px-ImH8qZRrCVs3c239nrYeP4lTyFMjPXACyI0SXm6U-fg-AtqqaUIK0fLOCOY3lfGAmOQMQOwU1lKhbZR-34B18Jkv9HKek5JQbte2NQklc1SGuGfi-ItXRzfpZ1LGpKYBxDcnh_b8OecnYia8cMTopwG7i2TnJJ0ItVHtCeFvg\"><img title=\"RPE and RIR\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjWFVx8kVEFd3GIB1px-ImH8qZRrCVs3c239nrYeP4lTyFMjPXACyI0SXm6U-fg-AtqqaUIK0fLOCOY3lfGAmOQMQOwU1lKhbZR-34B18Jkv9HKek5JQbte2NQklc1SGuGfi-ItXRzfpZ1LGpKYBxDcnh_b8OecnYia8cMTopwG7i2TnJJ0ItVHtCeFvg\" alt=\"RPE and RIR\" width=\"120\" height=\"240\" data-original-height=\"495\" data-original-width=\"248\"></a></p>\r\n<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>INTENSITY</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Intensity refers to how much you exert yourself in the gym or how heavy or intense you&rsquo;re lifting.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Method to measure your intensity:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>RPE scale</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhuC2WJ3LbY3Khus06bBHSsT8MLEnw8qlPSwLija2bPPtgZWyeYCoH_C9msb2fm5E8UT7LyHiOQn5uUeQICL1HmQg8HZlfQnnk_Rt3Znfb_62zHUmW-v3lzHN9wbkc-lCWz7yD0MJNKRjr6iS_Nwzs_9lXDsKubNoUmhPlm38E8f3zyjEaewd_llaOlsg\"><img title=\"RPE scale\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhuC2WJ3LbY3Khus06bBHSsT8MLEnw8qlPSwLija2bPPtgZWyeYCoH_C9msb2fm5E8UT7LyHiOQn5uUeQICL1HmQg8HZlfQnnk_Rt3Znfb_62zHUmW-v3lzHN9wbkc-lCWz7yD0MJNKRjr6iS_Nwzs_9lXDsKubNoUmhPlm38E8f3zyjEaewd_llaOlsg\" alt=\"RPE scale\" width=\"237\" height=\"240\" data-original-height=\"474\" data-original-width=\"469\"></a></div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A popular way of measuring your intensity is RPE(rate of perceived exertion) scale based on reps in reserve (RIR) scale.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">RPE scale is based on how close to failure you get at the conclusion of the set.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For instance, suppose you&rsquo;re squatting 100kg and after hitting 10 reps with 100kg, you&rsquo;ve no energy left to hit an extra rep, that means at 10th rep your RPE was 10(maximal) and your reps in reserve were zero.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Now considering 10th rep as your failure point, you decided to hit only 6 reps with 100kg. So, now your RPE will be 6 and RIR is 4.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>INTENSITY RECOMMENDATIONS</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Don&rsquo;t train to RPE 10 in compound exercises (bench press, squat, deadlift etc. In compound exercises you must train close to RPE 7-8 and should always have 2-3 reps in reserve because in compound exercises, various muscles are being targeted not only one muscle group. So, training to absolute failure will mount up the chances of injuries.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yes you can train to failure (RPE 9-10) in isolation exercises because in these exercises, only one muscle is being targeted and training to failure with proper technique won&rsquo;t exhaust you completely as in compound exercises.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can check out the list of compound and isolation exercise anywhere on internet, just google it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>REST PERIODS</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I had already covered this topic in one of my IG posts. I elucidated how much rest you need in compound and isolation exercises. I also busted some myths related to rest periods.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CD7rbbNDE7j/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Go check it out</a>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So, that&rsquo;s all about today&rsquo;s blog.

But flexibility ain&rsquo;t the prime focus of our workout, people often stretch prior to their workout for warming up and preparing their body for upcoming workout.</p>\r\n<p>There are numerous different type of stretching &ndash;&nbsp;dynamic, static, ballistic and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation(PNF).&nbsp;But the&nbsp;two most important stretches&nbsp;which are bone of contention in the fitness industry are dynamic and static stretching.&nbsp;Which is suitable to be done before workout?</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-larger-font-size\">STATIC STRETCHING</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.richlevyperformance.co.uk/uploads/xiDz9HME/Thedifferencebetweendynamicandstaticstretching.jpg\" alt=\"\"></figure>\r\n<p>In static stretching, you stretch a muscle or group of muscles by holding the stretch for a period of time. The stretch is generally held for 20-60 seconds. This is then repeated 2-4 times.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-larger-font-size\"><strong>DYNAMIC STRETCHING</strong></p>\r\n<p>Dynamic stretching is more functionally oriented stretch. Sport specific movements are used to move the limbs through greater range of motion. It involves whole body movements and actively moving a joint without holding the movement. This is generally repeated around 10-12 times.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-larger-font-size\">Which of the stretching is apt to be done prior to workout?</p>\r\n<p>Earlier it was perceived that stretching before any workout, actively or sport would reduce the chances of injuries and prepare the body for grueling workout to come.</p>\r\n<p>But recent studies suggest that if you stretch before a workout, you might have higher chances of injury than if you don&rsquo;t especially if you&rsquo;re doing static stretching. There&rsquo;s also other evidence that performing some types of stretching before workout might decrease power and speed which eventuated in coaches and personal trainers recommending that any stretching before workout should be dynamic stretching.</p>\r\n<p>The most likely reason why static stretching should be avoided before workout is that holding the stretch drains out your muscles.</p>\r\n<p>You should warm up by doing dynamic stretches which are like your workout but at a lower intensity. Doing dynamic stretching with the same intensity as your workout will also drain you out before workout. So, keep the intensity of dynamic stretching to lower side.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\">STRETCHING AFTER WORKOUT/EXERCISE?</p>\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to forsake static stretching, then doing it after the completion of your workout would be a much much better option. Researches have attested that static stretching after workout can relieve muscle soreness to about 2-3 mm on a 100 mm scale or in simple words up to 2-3%. Everybody is more flexible after their workout because you&rsquo;ve increased the blood circulation to those muscles and joints as you&rsquo;ve been moving them in your workout.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-larger-font-size\"><strong>TAKEAWAY:</strong></p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-318\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 300px;\" src=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/93382226_901840146947152_2098622536672608256_o.png?w=1024\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/93382226_901840146947152_2098622536672608256_o.png?w=1024 1024w, https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/93382226_901840146947152_2098622536672608256_o.png?w=150 150w, https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/93382226_901840146947152_2098622536672608256_o.png?w=300 300w, https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/93382226_901840146947152_2098622536672608256_o.png?w=768 768w, https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/93382226_901840146947152_2098622536672608256_o.png 1080w\" alt=\"dynamic stretching vs static stretching\" data-attachment-id=\"318\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"93382226_901840146947152_2098622536672608256_o\" data-large-file=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/93382226_901840146947152_2098622536672608256_o.png?w=580\" data-medium-file=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/93382226_901840146947152_2098622536672608256_o.png?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/93382226_901840146947152_2098622536672608256_o.png\" data-orig-size=\"1080,1080\" data-permalink=\"https://smarttrainee.health.blog/93382226_901840146947152_2098622536672608256_o/\"></figure>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-large-font-size\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-large-font-size\">So that&rsquo;s all about today&rsquo;s blog.

So arbitrarily, 40% from carbohydrates means 0.4*2700 = 1080 calories from carbohydrate sources, 35% from protein means 945 calories from protein, 25% from fat means 675 calories from fat sources.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color\"><strong>KETO DIET</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the keto diet, there is a drastic reduction in the consumption of carbohydrates and they are supplanted with fat.</p>\r\n<p>In a keto diet, you would consume 55-60% of total daily calories from fats, 25-30% from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smarttraineeblogs.blogspot.com/2022/08/everything-you-need-to-know-about.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protein</a>&nbsp;and 5-10% from carbohydrates.</p>\r\n<p>let&rsquo;s take the previous example of 2700 calories, in keto it will be like &ndash; 60% from fat means 1620 calories from fat, 30% from protein means 810 calories and 10% from carbohydrates means 270 calories.</p>\r\n<p>This diet style is particularly invented for folks seeking&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smarttraineeblogs.blogspot.com/2022/08/simple-science-based-tips-for-fat-loss.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fat loss</a>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-large-font-size\"><strong>MYTHS REGARDING KETO DIET</strong></p>\r\n<p>People fallaciously fancy that keto has an edge over other diet styles especially low carb diet because in keto diet, drastically reducing carbohydrates and increasing fat intake put the body in&nbsp;KETOSIS&nbsp;in which your body utilizes fats as main source of energy over carbohydrates.</p>\r\n<p>Folks misinterpret this statement as more fat loss because the body is utilizing fat as it&rsquo;s primary energy source.</p>\r\n<p>What they don&rsquo;t think is that if they&rsquo;re burning more calories/energy from fat, they&rsquo;re also consuming profuse amount of fat. On the other side, in low carb if you&rsquo;re burning less calories/energy from fat, you&rsquo;re also consuming low amount of fat. So, there is equilibrium.</p>\r\n<p>In essence, keto has no edge over low carb diet for fat loss and it is also substantiated by researches as well.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>INTERMITTENT FASTING</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is more of an eating pattern rather than a diet style.</p>\r\n<p>It does not say anything about which food you should eat but rather when you should eat it.

It varies from individual to individual.</p>\r\n<p>If someone love eating too many fats, keto is best for him and low carb is worst and conversely if someone relish eating carbohydrates, low carb is best for him and keto is worst.&nbsp;In a nutshell, IT DEPENDS.</p>\r\n<p>The cornerstone of fat loss will always remains the calorie deficit, whether to create that deficit from keto, low carb, intermittent fasting &ndash; that&rsquo;s up to your needs and preferences.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>DIET FOR GAINERS</strong></p>\r\n<p>As i blabbered that for fat loss you need to create a calorie deficit. In the same way for weight gain you need to create a calorie surplus means you should consume more calories than your body needs to maintain current weight. You can commence with 250-500 calories surplus followed by a well balanced diet which contains 40-45% carbohydrates, 25-30% fat, 25-35%&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smarttraineeblogs.blogspot.com/2022/08/different-types-of-protein-supplements.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protein</a>.</p>\r\n<p>PRO TIP:&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t create a humongous surplus of 1000 calories in the beginning because in that case, you will gain muscle but that will come at the expense of gaining the ungodly amount of fat. Commence with small surplus of 250 calories and than increase it gradually according to your goal.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, that is it for today&rsquo;s blog, I've explained you all about&nbsp;<strong>different types of diet styles and which one would be best for you.</strong></p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll see you all in my next blog, till then stay fit, keep exercising and be benevolent towards others.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"post-bottom\">\r\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\r\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"post-share-buttons post-share-buttons-bottom\">\r\n<div class=\"byline post-share-buttons goog-inline-block\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>", "tag": [2, 3]}}, {"model": "blogs.post", "pk": 28, "fields": {"title": "Vital Micronutrients you should be consuming", "excerpt": "In this blog, I am going to explain about some Vital  Micronutrients you should consider consuming for Good Health.", "author": 6, "image": "images/vitamins-functions-and-food-sources_01005216_167596.jpg", "slug": "vital-micronutrients-you-should-be-consuming", "date": "2022-10-18", "content": "<div class=\"post-body-container\">\r\n<div id=\"post-body-5033650902072343328\" class=\"post-body entry-content float-container\">\r\n<p>In this blog, I am going to explain about some <strong>Vital&nbsp; Micronutrients&nbsp;</strong>you should consider consuming for Good Health.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"featured-media\">\r\n<div class=\"featured-media-inner section-inner\"><img class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/vitamins-functions-and-food-sources_01005216_167596.jpg?w=1200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/vitamins-functions-and-food-sources_01005216_167596.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/vitamins-functions-and-food-sources_01005216_167596.jpg?w=150 150w, https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/vitamins-functions-and-food-sources_01005216_167596.jpg?w=300 300w, https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/vitamins-functions-and-food-sources_01005216_167596.jpg?w=768 768w, https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/vitamins-functions-and-food-sources_01005216_167596.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/vitamins-functions-and-food-sources_01005216_167596.jpg 1280w\" alt=\"micro-nutrients\" width=\"268\" height=\"151\" data-attachment-id=\"554\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"vitamins-functions-and-food-sources_01005216_167596\" data-large-file=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/vitamins-functions-and-food-sources_01005216_167596.jpg?w=580\" data-medium-file=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/vitamins-functions-and-food-sources_01005216_167596.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://fitnessmadeeasyhealth.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/vitamins-functions-and-food-sources_01005216_167596.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1280,720\" data-permalink=\"https://smarttrainee.health.blog/2021/01/03/vital-micronutrients/vitamins-functions-and-food-sources_01005216_167596/\"></div>\r\n</figure>\r\n<div class=\"post-inner thin\">\r\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p>There are two broad categories of micronutrients in nutrition i.e.&nbsp;Minerals(which are inorganic), Vitamins(organic).</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>MINERALS</strong></p>\r\n<p>Minerals are those inorganic things that are on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sciencenotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/PeriodicTableWallpaper2017.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">periodic table</a>.

It is easier to overdose because they stay in our body for longer and thus they&rsquo;re harder to eradicate. And it is more unlikely to that you&rsquo;ll be deficient unless it&rsquo;s a consistency issue.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>DEFICIENCY EFFECTS</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Iron deficiency which is especially common in female athletes. In one study, on a group of female volleyball players who were supplemented with iron, it was found that during strength testing the iron supplemented group displayed greater total strength across a range of barbell lifts compared to the control group that did not receive iron supplementation.</li>\r\n<li>Zinc deficiency can negatively impact your metabolism.</li>\r\n<li>Calcium deficiency can negatively impact bone health.</li>\r\n<li>Vitamin deficiency effects &ndash;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-deficiency#1.-Brittle-hair-and-nails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">check here.</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>HOW TO OBVIATE DEFICIENCIES?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The premier way to keep track of your micronutrients consumption is to&nbsp;ensure that you&rsquo;re consuming 1 serving of fruits and vegetables per 1000 calories that you ingest per day.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if your daily calorie intake is 2000, you should aim to consume 2 servings of fruits and fibrous vegetables per day.</p>\r\n<p>On the flip side, a very huge or proactive individual who regularly consumes 4000-5000 calories per day might face difficulties if she or he has to consume 4-5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily. In that case, getting 3 or even just 2 serving would be suffice in order to prevent excessive bloating or fullness.</p>\r\n<p>So, that's all about this blog.

Citrulline is very readily converted into arginine as needed and it is also better absorbed than arginine, which not only makes it a better source of arginine for the body but also eventuates in a lower rate of gastrointestinal upset.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-larger-font-size\">Benefits?</p>\r\n<p>Several studies have shown that citrulline malate can improve weight training performance.</p>\r\n<p>In a research, participants who took citrulline were able to perform 53% more repetitions compared to participants who took placebo(A&nbsp;placebo&nbsp;is anything that seems to be a &ldquo;real&rdquo; medical treatment &mdash; but isn&rsquo;t.

Artificial sweeteners are just one type of sugar substitute.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-subtle-background-background-color has-text-color has-background has-larger-font-size\"><strong>ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS??</strong></p>\r\n<p>Artificial sweeteners are synthetic sugar substitutes. But they may be derived from naturally occurring substances, such as herbs or sugar itself.</p>\r\n<p>Artificial sweeteners can be an enticing alternative to sugar because they add virtually no calories to your diet and are much sweeter than sugar.</p>\r\n<p>Also, you need only a fraction of artificial sweetener compared with the amount of sugar you would normally use for sweetness.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-subtle-background-background-color has-text-color has-background has-larger-font-size\">HOW DO THEY WORK?</p>\r\n<p>The surface of your tongue is covered by many taste buds, each containing several taste receptors that detect different flavors. When you eat, your taste receptors encounter food molecules. A perfect fit between a receptor and molecule sends a signal to your brain, allowing you to identify the taste.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, the sugar molecules fits perfectly into your taste receptor for sweetness, allowing your brain to identify the sweet taste. Artificial sweetener molecules are identical enough to sugar molecules to fit on the sweetness receptor. However, they&rsquo;re generally too different from sugar for your body to break them down into calories. This is how they provide a sweet taste without the added calories.</p>\r\n<p class=\"has-subtle-background-background-color has-text-color has-background has-larger-font-size\">Some Artificial Sweeteners</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Aspartame:&nbsp;Sold under brand name NutraSweet, equal or sugartwin, aspartame is 200 times sweeter than table sugar.</li>\r\n<li>Advantame:&nbsp;This sweetener is 20,000 times sweeter than table sugar and is suited for cooking and baking.</li>\r\n<li>Sucralose:&nbsp;Sucralose, which is 600 times sweeter than table sugar is suited for cooking, baking and mixing with acidic foods</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p class=\"has-subtle-background-background-color has-text-color has-background has-larger-font-size\">Health Benefits</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Weight control:&nbsp;</strong>Artificial sweeteners have virtually no calories. In contrast, a teaspoon of sugar has about 16 calories. So, if you&rsquo;re trying to lose weight or prevent weight gain, artificial sweeteners can be a peachy alternative. Several studies have also attested that artificial sweeteners can help with weight loss.(I've&nbsp;<strong>posted a blog</strong>&nbsp;on the best science based&nbsp;<strong>tips to lose fat</strong>, you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smarttraineeblogs.blogspot.com/2022/08/simple-science-based-tips-for-fat-loss.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">check it out too</a>)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Diabetes:</strong>&nbsp;Artificial sweeteners aren&rsquo;t carbohydrates.
